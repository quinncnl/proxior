## Proxior

Proxior can be seen as an HTTP layer router or a proxy manager. Its concept quite resembles the chrome plugins SwitchySharp and PAC. 

It supports HTTP proxy and socks5 proxy.

Proxior does not support authentication at this time. If you really need it, configure a Squid Cache and set Proxior to be its parent proxy.
